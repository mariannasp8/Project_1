# What is this game about?

Hey space friend! We came to ask for your help. 
Our planet is being invaded by 3 different types' of aliens. We have to be careful because the third type moves at distinct velocities and can hit our spaceship.
Furthermore, we can defend ourselves bit shooting against the 2 fixed position aliens, called RT32 and H12 and for each of them we receive points. Hitting the RT32 we can sum 50 points and hitting H12, as it is smaller, we can gain 100 points.
The moving aliens, usually known by FW58, are invincible, so we can just avoid them. If they hit us we lose 100 points, but, if they hit us 3 times, our mission will not be complete.
If we can score up to 6000 points in less than a minute we have conquered our planet again!

# Curiosity
-The inspiration it was obviously the space invaders game that remembers my childhood;
-The name of the game SOLARIS, came from one movie from one of my favorites movies director Tarkovsky Solaris from 1972
